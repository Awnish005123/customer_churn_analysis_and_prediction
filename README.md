# ðŸ“‚ Overview

**Background**

This dataset contains **credit card customer data** from Kaggle. It includes real-world customer behavior with features related to demographics, credit usage, and account activity.

This binary classification problem aims to **predict whether a customer will churn** based on their profile and activity.

**Goal of the Project**

Build a machine learning model to **predict whether a customer will leave the credit card service** (`Attrition_Flag`: Attrited/Existing).
